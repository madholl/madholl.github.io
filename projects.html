This application is expected to collect data from the biomechanics devices in real-time. It allows the researcher to connect to the device via bluetooth, scan the plant’s QR code that they are running the current test on, start the device, run the test, collect the data, and store those data values locally and remotely." class="project-img" onclick="myFunction(this);">
