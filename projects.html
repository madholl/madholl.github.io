          <h3>Fridge Daddy is an independent or collaborative application where the user inputs ingredients they currently have or what type of meal they would like to create, and generates a list of options for them to make. Users can then add these recipes to a personal cookbook tied to their account or a shared cookbook with other “chefs”. Users can also choose to upload their own recipes, or share their cookbooks with friends.</h3>

          <h3>MaizeMaster is an iPadOS application, that was created to assist The Sparks Lab at the University of Delaware in their research to measure plant biomechanics, in this case maize, to limit crop loss due to mechanical failure. This application is expected to collect data from the biomechanics devices in real-time. It allows the researcher to connect to the device via bluetooth, scan the plant’s QR code that they are running the current test on, start the device, run the test, collect the data, and store those data values locally and remotely.</h3>

          <h3>SuperKid is a choose your own adventure game, where the kid playing gets to customize their own superpower and superhero, who is then faced with decisions that decide their fate. The learning objectives for this game are to demonstrate critical thinking skills, to contrast the consequences of each option they are presented with, to develop a strong sense of morality, to build inner-confidence, and to adapt against their enemy (who is also a kid, just like them).</h3>

          <h3>UDress Magazine is a fully student-run fashion and lifestyle magazine here at the University of Delaware. I joined the layout team my freshman year, and my responsibilities were to graphically design the layout of a spread given the article and photographs of the spread. This position taught me the importance of innovative and sleek design, and is directly applicable to my experiences building front-end platforms as a software engineer. I was promoted to assistant art director, and then eventually head art director on the executive board last year.</h3>
